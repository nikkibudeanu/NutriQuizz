* # Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is featured on all pages. The navigation bar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without  using the ‘back’ button. It includes links to the quiz, high score page and a logo created by me in Canva. It turns into a hamburger menu on phone screens.

* # Logo
The logo was created in Canva and I used the same font family as the headings "LibreFranklin Black". It is clickable and brings you to the home page.

* # How to play section
This section is animated using CSS and Javascript. It slides from left and right while scrolling and it includes an instruction on how to play the quiz. It is the second section on the home page.

On mobile screens, the navbar turns into a hamburger menu.

# 4. SKELETON 

## Mockups were created using Figma. 

### Initial Wireframes 

The project initially was meant to have 3 levels. However, I could not figure out how to efficiently link the levels through Javascript and I ended up only doing one level. This is why, my initial wireframes were the below ones.
